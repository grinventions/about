# Grinventions

Light bulb means "inventions", and we intend to make those inventions in the [grin cryptocurrency](https://grin.mw/) which is an open-source, community-driven implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol. Don't ask me why the light bulb looks angry, that was not intentional. I wish it looked happy but I guess it is out of my control.

I established this organization to put bunch of repos I was working on in my spare time. I hope to make at least some of them public. I have not requested any funding for work on any of them, if you ask why, please refer to the mememetic scene from the movie I like below:

The goal as for now is to implemente the Mimblewimble protocol in Python, JavaScript and PHP in order to allow wallets, nodes, payment processors and other nice thingies being made in those languages.

## Projects in progress

1. [mimblewimble-py](https://github.com/grinventions/mimblewimble-py) Python implementation of Mimblewimble protocol for Grin. Will allow easy implementation Python-based wallets, nodes, payment processors, payment-proof verificators etc.

## Roadmap (whatever)

Some stuff I wanna have

1. Mimblewimble module in Python/JavaScript/PHP, capable of handling outputs, transactions, blocks slatepacks etc.
2. Translation of [grinmw](https://github.com/grinfans/grinmw.py) by [@xiaojay](https://github.com/xiaojay) to PHP.
3. Implementation of grin payment method as Woocommerce/Magento plugins for e-commerce (without the need of running any listeners apart from providing access to a node).
4. A payment gateway similar to [BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/) that runs on cheap hosting servers and requires only access to a running node.

## Updates

I am going to regularly write what has been done in the [telegram channel](https://t.me/grinventions). Stay tuned!

## Support

This project is NOT financed from the grin fund neither grin community fund. I deliverately did not request funding because of the following reasons:

1. I am not certain how much time I will be able to dedicate to it
2. I want this project to earn trust from the community, not have it guaranteed upfront
