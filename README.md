# Grinventions

Light bulb means "inventions", and we intend to make those inventions in the [grin cryptocurrency](https://grin.mw/) which is an open-source, community-driven implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol. Don't ask me why the light bulb looks angry, that was not intentional. I wish it looked happy but I guess it is out of my control.

I established this organization to put bunch of repos I was working on in my spare time. I hope to make at least some of them public. I have not requested any funding for work on any of them, if you ask why, please refer to the mememetic scene from the movie I like below:

The goal as for now is to implemente the Mimblewimble protocol in Python, JavaScript and PHP in order to allow wallets, nodes, payment processors and other nice thingies being made in those languages.
